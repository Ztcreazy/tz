I am a second-year master student at Mechatronics and Embedded Control Systems (https://www.kth.se/mmk/mechatronics/), KTH Royal Institute of Technology (https://www.kth.se/en), Stockholm Sweden. My research interests include control theory, distributed computing, networked control, networked systems, optimal control, and optimization. Right now I am working as a research assistant at Digital Futures (https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/) and (https://www.kth.se/en/tekmek/forskargrupper/marina-system), where I focus on distributed stochastic receding horizon control for collision avoidance through vehicle coordination under networked delays in V2V communication and robust model predictive control for next generation hydrofoil systems of robust and cost-effective electric work boats.

Attached is my CV and contact information.
