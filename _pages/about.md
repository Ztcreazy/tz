I am a second-year master student at [Unit of Mechatronics and Embedded Control Systems](https://www.kth.se/mmk/mechatronics/), [Department of Engineering Design](https://www.kth.se/mmk), [School of Industrial Engineering and Management](https://www.kth.se/en/itm), [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en), Stockholm Sweden. My research interests include control theory, distributed computing, networked control, networked systems, optimal control, and optimization. Right now I am working as a research assistant at [Digital Futures](https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/) and [Naval Architecture](https://www.kth.se/en/tekmek/forskargrupper/marina-system), [Department of Engineering Mechanics](https://www.kth.se/en/tekmek), [School of Engineering Sciences](https://www.kth.se/en/sci) where I focus on distributed stochastic receding horizon control for collision avoidance through vehicle coordination under networked delays in V2V communication and robust model predictive control for next generation hydrofoil systems of robust and cost-effective electric work boats.

Attached is my CV and contact information.
